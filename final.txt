 Finance Manager Application

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Finance Manager Application is designed to assist in organizing and managing financial transactions. 
It allows users to input, store, and analyze transactions, generate reports, and perform financial calculations.

PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION: To run the Finance Manager Application, compile the source code using the Makefile by running the command make in the terminal. 
After successful compilation, run the generated FinanceManager executable to launch the program. 
The program provides a menu-based interface for users to navigate through different functionalities, such as adding transactions, 
viewing reports, and performing financial analyses. The program does not require any additional libraries or dependencies.

CLASS DESCRIPTION: The custom class I created for this project is TransactionManager, which encapsulates data and functionality related to managing financial transactions. 
The class includes private data members such as a list of transactions, methods for adding and retrieving transactions, generating reports, and performing 
financial calculations. Creating the TransactionManager class helped me structure the program by centralizing transaction-related operations into a single class.

LIST DATA STRUCTURE: My program uses a linked list data structure to store and manage transactions efficiently. I chose a linked list for its dynamic memory
 allocation capabilities, allowing for easy insertion and deletion of transactions without requiring fixed-size arrays or manual memory management. 
 

FILE I/O: File I/O is incorporated into my application to read and write transaction data from/to external files. 
This function lets users to save transaction records and load previously saved data into the program.
 File I/O was necessary to provide users with the ability to store transaction history across program sessions and to facilitate data backup and recovery.

REFLECTIONS: Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in designing and implementing a complex software application from scratch. 
I encountered challenges in structuring the program architecture, managing data, and implementing file handling functionalities. 
If I were to do another project, I would focus on refining the user interface,
 adding more advanced financial analysis features, and implementing data encryption for enhanced security.
